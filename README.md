# Redux quiz group project

This project was made during the Technigo bootcamp. We used Redux for the first time to build a multiple-choice quiz game. We've been working in a group of five, using mob-programming in pairs and git-branches.


## The problem
We started with planning the project in Figma deciding type of quiz, design and what kind of components we first thought was needed. Since we've different time schedules we also mapped out who worked when. The plan was to at least build the base in group, but due to schedule we needed to split up.

We used the techniques that's associated with Redux and also got more practice in React styled components.

We reached several stretch goals, including using images in the quiz (this time used as options), conditional color rendering of right/wrong answers and a 30s timer that pressures the user to select an answer, otherwise it will move on with 0 points and a built progress bar. 

If we had more time we would have worked more on the styling of the quiz, but this week focused on understanding the code.
